build an app that help people save money. HAve them set a financial goal target, they can put money in but cant take it out. they can only take it out once the goal is completed.  they should be able to take out a loan based on the value of how much they have deposited. theyll never be able to take outmore than 10% of their loan via a loan.no credt


kinda like cashapp(ease of access) meets self meets credit karma(see credit score and report and dispute) meet ally(ease of use and can create multiple accounts) meets self(make it easy to save money and cant take it out and also allows loans based on funds deposited) meets coinbase(accept certain cryptos) meets webull (you can copy other peoples saving strategies and accounts) meets facebook you can interact with users anonymously and build business relationships and friendships if you opt in for the feature
